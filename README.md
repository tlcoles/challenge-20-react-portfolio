# Challenge 20: React Portfolio
An assignment of the ESMT Coding Boot Camp. The challenge is to build a portfolio website using React. Thus, this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I also relied on the free tutorial ["How to Build a Portfolio Website with React"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-portfolio-website-react/) provided by FreeCodeCamp.
